# MENUINO UI
## UI system for Arduino and touchscreens

This project is a simple way to create a complete UI system for TDT/LCD touchscreens for the Arduino microcontrollers (and other supported platforms).

For each screen, a new class should be created extending the base class `Screen`.

Actually, the sketch is using an OPEN-SMART TFT 3.2", but it can be easily replaced changing the includes and the initialization calls on the `TouchDisplay` class.
